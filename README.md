#### A set of 50 awesome loading indicators, free to use.<br />
#### Written in pure Swift, using Core Animation.<br />
#### Made with [Flow](https://createwithflow.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=activityindicatorview).<br />

# Usage
Each class has its own unique initializer. For example:

```
GriddyActivityIndicatorView(frame: frame)
```

You can also use our convience class, like so:

```
ActivityIndicators.create(.griddy)
```

# Structure
We offer a common, basic subclass of `UIActivityIndicatorView`.

```
ActivityIndicatorView: UIActivityIndicatorView {
  ...
}
```

This basic handles the construction of the activity view, provides the space for common styling additions, and syncs playback with native activity indicator methods.

## Custom Subclasses
Each indicator is a subclass of `ActivityIndicatorView`.

```
GriddyActivityIndicatorView: ActivityIndicatorView {
  ...
}
```

# Flow Common
Animations are written in swift, and require a few lightweight classes for managing views. These can be found in [FlowCommoniOS](https://github.com/createwithflow/FlowCommoniOS).

Our animations take full advantage of native Core Animation, most prominently `CAKeyFrameAnimation`.

Here is a sample of our animation code:

```
let strokeend_pentagon: CAKeyframeAnimation = {
    let keyframeAnimation = CAKeyframeAnimation()
    keyframeAnimation.keyPath = "strokeEnd"
    keyframeAnimation.values = [0.16, 0.99]
    keyframeAnimation.keyTimes = [0, 1] 
    keyframeAnimation.timingFunctions = [.easeInEaseOut]
    keyframeAnimation.duration = duration
    
    return keyframeAnimation
}()
```
